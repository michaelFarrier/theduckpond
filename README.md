# Idea
Our activitiy is going to be a varient of duck hunt where 1 player becomes a hunter and the other player becomes ducks.  
The ducks avoid being tagged by the hunter and if a duck is tagged it will trigger a 1v1 typing battle.  
The hunter wins if he can kill all the ducks in a set time frame.  
The ducks win if they outlast the hunter.
